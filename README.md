# -Create-a-Wireframe
Created a low-fidelity wireframe for a landing page using Figma. The design includes key sections like header, hero, features, testimonials, and footer. Using grayscale boxes and placeholder text, the wireframe outlines layout and structure clearly. It serves as a blueprint for future high-fidelity UI design and development.
